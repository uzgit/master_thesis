\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


I would like to thank my family for their undying love, support, and encouragement which have gotten me this far.

\vspace{0.5cm}\noindent
My thanks go to Mälardalen University, Reykjavík University, and the Nordic Council, without whose generosity in the MDH Scholarship and the Nordic Master Programme, I would not have had the opportunity to study my passion in two wonderful countries.

% \vspace{0.5cm}\noindent
% Finally, I would like to thank the medical workers and everyone on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, who have put their lives on the line to help others. We are all indebted to you.
