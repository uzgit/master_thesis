ArduPilot is a popular implementation of the aforementioned open source autopilot software. It was chosen for this project because of its large user base (which provides quick testing and bug fixes), because of the familiarity of the author to the software in previous work, and because of time constraints in the context of this project. Learning a new autopilot system would slow down other development. However, the system developed in this thesis interacts with ArduPilot externally, without editing the ArduPilot code. Since the interfaces used by the system are common to both ArduPilot and PX4, the system could easily be ported to work with PX4. However, testing of this is beyond the scope of this thesis.
