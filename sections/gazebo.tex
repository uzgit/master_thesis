Gazebo \cite{gazebo} is an open source simulation tool developed for Linux. It provides a 3-dimensional environment and a physics engine which allow users to simulate interaction between objects and the environment. Models and worlds can be defined and edited using \texttt{.sdf} and \texttt{.world} files respectively. These files allow users to specify the defining characteristics of each model, such as collision planes which determine how models can make contact with other models or other components within the environment.  Gazebo provides interfaces for simulated sensors, such as inertial measurement units, cameras, LIDAR units, etc., and these sensors can be included in \texttt{.sdf} files in order to provide the relevant information to the model. Plugins can also be included in both \texttt{.sdf} and \texttt{.world} files in order to provide additional functionality, such as \gls{PID} controllers and simulated wind. Several other open source simulators are also available. However Gazebo's existing, readily-compatible plugins for both ArduPilot and ROS make it a good candidate for this project.
