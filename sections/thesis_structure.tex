The motivated design and data flow of the gimbal and landing controllers is presented in Chapter 1, along with the supporting software infrastructure, and conditions of the simulation environment. Quantitative analyses of the performances of these systems within the simulator are presented in Chapter 3. Guidelines for the migration of this system from the simulator to a physical drone are presented in Chapter 4.
